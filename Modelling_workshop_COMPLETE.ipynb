        "# INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of computational modeling in behavioral science is to use precise mathematical models to make better sense of behavioral data. The behavioral data most often come in the form of choices, but can also be reaction times, eye movements, or other easily observable behaviors, and even neural data. The models come in the form of mathematical equations that link the experimentally observable variables (e.g. stimuli, outcomes, past experiences) to behavior in the immediate future. In this sense, computational models instantiate different ‘algorithmic hypotheses’ about how behavior is generated.\n",

        "Computational modelling is a very extensive topic, but in this workshop we will go over three uses of modelling that dominate the literature:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Part 1: Simulations.** We will learn how to simulate data from a *synthetic agent* playing an n-armed bandit task. We will understand how the Rescorla-Wagner model works, and how it can inform action selection. Finally, we will get an intuition of how the parameters of the model can have an impact on behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Part 2: Parameter fitting.** We will fit a dataset to our model and take a look at what parameters best explain the behavior in the dataset. We will also take a look at best practices, such as parameter recovery.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Part 3: Model comparison.** We will learn how to decide which of several models best explains a dataset."

        "\n",
        "In this workshop, we will focus on Reinforcement Learning (RL) tasks. RL is a type of learning where individuals learn to make decisions by receiving rewards or punishments for their actions. By modeling RL, we can study how humans and animals learn from experience, optimize their actions to achieve goals, and adapt to changing environments. This approach provides insights into motivation, learning processes, and decision-making strategies.\n",

        "### The n-armed bandit problem\n",
        "\n",
        "The n-armed bandit task is a classic problem in reinforcement learning and behavioral psychology. Imagine you are in a casino with several slot machines (also called \"bandits\"), each with a different probability of paying out a reward when played. Your goal is to maximize your total reward over a series of plays. However, you don't know the payout probabilities of the machines in advance, so you must learn which machines are the most rewarding through trial and error.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can design bandit tasks with different number of bandits and reward policies (i.e., constant reward probabilities, drifting, reversal tasks...). Here we will focuss on a two-armed badnit task (i.e., with only two bandits) with constant reward probabilities.\n",

        "\n",
        "The Rescorla-Wagner rule is a model of classical conditioning that describes how the strength of an association between a stimulus and an outcome is updated over time. In the context of a two-armed bandit task, this rule can be used to model how individuals learn to associate each of the two options (or \"arms\") with their respective rewards.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Rescorla-Wagner Model includes three main variables:\n",
        "\n",
        "* $Q_t(a)$: the Q-value of bandit *a* on trial *t*, which represents the expected reward associated with that bandit in that trial (i.e., the prediction of how likely the bandit is to give a reward).\n",
        "\n",
        "* $R_t$: the outcome (i.e., reward or nothing) received after choosing a bandit on trial *t*.\n",
        "\n",
        "* $\\alpha$: the learning rate, which determines how quickly the model updates the Q-values based on new information.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Rescorla-Wagner rule relies on a prediction error ($\\delta_t$), which is the difference between the actual reward ($R_t$) and the predicted reward ($Q_t$) of the chosen bandit ($a_t$) on trial *t*:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\delta_t = R_t - Q_t(a_t)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "With the reward prediction error $\\delta_t$, we can update the value of the chosen option $Q_t(a_t)$ to obtain $Q_{t+1}(a_t)$:\n",

        "$$Q_{t+1}(a_t) = Q_t(a_t) + \\alpha*\\delta_t$$\n",
        "\n",
        "For the update, we *could* simply add the reward prediction error $\\delta_t$ to our old value estimate $Q_t$, to immediately arrive at $R_t$, the true outcome. However, we don't really want to move *all the way* from the old value $V_t$ to the actual outcome $r_t$. We only want to move *a little bit*, in order to keep around some of the things we have already learned in the past.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is the reason why we first multiply $\\delta_t$ by $\\alpha$, the *learning rate*, before we add it to $Q_t(a_t)$. (The learning rate $\\alpha$ is a number between 0 and 1 that \"scales\" the reward prediction error. For example, if $\\alpha=0.25$, we move a quarter of the way from $Q_t$ to $R_t$.)\n",

        "A really important step in computational modelling is to create fake, or surrogate data. That is, you should use the models that you are considering to simulate the behavior of participants in the experiment, and to observe how behavior changes with different models, different model parameters, and different variants of the experiment. This is important since it will allow us to form concrete predictions about what our models predict, which we can then compare with actual behavioral data.\n",

It outputs a numpy array containing a the choice made on each trial based on the model (as well, as their associated outcomes, the accuracy of each choice and the Q-values of each bandit).\n",

Latent variable inference is especially useful in neuroimaging where it is used to help search for the neural correlates of the model.\n",

Finding qualitative signatures (and there will often be more than one) of the model is crucial. By studying these measures with simulated data, you will have greater intuition about what is going on when you use the same model-independent measures to analyze real behavior.\n",

Let's simulate a bandit playing many blocks of the task, and then let's see how its average accuracy evolves as it progresses through the block:"

        "A key component of computational modeling is estimating the values of the parameters that best describe your behavioral data. There are a number of different ways of estimating parameters, but here we focus on the maximum-likelihood approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the maximum likelihood approach to model fitting, our goal is to find the parameter values of model m ($\\theta_m$) that maximize the likelihood of the data, $d_{1:T}$, given the parameters, $p(d_{1:T}|\\theta_m)$. For instance, in our RW model the parameters are the learning rate and inverse tempretature ($\\theta_{RW}={\\alpha,\\beta}$, but other models may have different parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Maximizing the likelihood is equivalent to maximizing the log of the likelihood, $LL=log(p(d_{1:T}|\\theta_m))$, which is numerically more tractable. (The likelihood is a product of many numbers smaller than 1, which can be rounded to 0 with limited precision computing. By contrast, the log-likelihood is a sum of negative numbers, which is usually tractable and will not be rounded to 0.) A simple mathematical derivation shows that this log-likelihood can be written in terms of the choice probabilities of the individual model as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$LL=log(p(d_{1:T}|\\theta_m,m))=\\sum_{t=1}^{T}log(p(c_t|p(d_{1:t-1},\\theta_m,m))$$\n",

        "where $p(c_t|p(d_{1:t-1},\\theta_m,m)$ is the probability of each individual choice ($c_t$) given the parameters of the model ($\\theta_m$) and the information available up to that choice ($d_{1:t-1}$). The parameters that we can change (to explain the behavior of different participants) ($\\theta_m$) are usually called the \"free parameters\" of the model.\n",

To model this behavior, we assume that participants choose between the two options randomly, perhaps with some overall bias for one option over the other.

        "This was just a taster of what modelling allows. There are many more methods and models that can be used to study many aspects of human behavior (and cognition). If you want you can take a look at the paper that inspired this workshop ([Ten simple rules for the computational modeling of behavioral data](https://elifesciences.org/articles/49547) or at [Reinforcement learning: an Introduction (Sutton and Barto)](https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/SuttonBartoIPRLBook2ndEd.pdf), (i.e., the holly Bible of RL research). The next step is to take what you have learned, extend it, and apply it to your own research. Good luck!\n",
